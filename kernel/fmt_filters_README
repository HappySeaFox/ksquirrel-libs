Some filters are ported from KDE's KImageEffect. See fmt_filters.h for more.
Resize methods are ported from DevIL library. See fmt_filters.h for more.

* fmt_filters is a regular C++ namespace.
* it is a set of image filters, written on pure C++.
* it is intended to create platform-independed filters, which can be used anywhere -
    in KDE, GNOME, ... apps.
* these source files are distributed with ksquirrel-libs from http://ksquirrel.sf.net.
* you can find the latest version of fmt_filters at http://ksquirrel.sf.net/subprojects.php.
* fmt_filters work with 32-bit image data.
* to use it in your project, simply add fmt_filters sources to your project.
* fmt_filters is distributed under the terms of LGPL. See COPYING for details.

        - swirl
        - noise
        - flatten

Qt example:
-----------

QImage im;

im.load("sample.png");

fmt_filters::image img(sample.bits(), sample.width(), sample.height());

fmt_filters::implode(img, 50, fmt_filters::white);

QPixmap p;

p.convertFromImage(im);

pixmapLabel->setPixmap(p);
