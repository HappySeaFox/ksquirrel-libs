:warning: KSquirrel and KSquirrel-libs are not maintained anymore. Even though
simplicity and modularity lay in the heart of KSquirrel-libs, some of its design decisions or implemented classes
are really controversial.

KSquirrel-libs have been rebranded in 2020 as a fast and lightweight cross-platform image library called [SAIL](https://github.com/HappySeaFox/sail).
You can still try KSquirrel in the [Trinity Desktop](https://www.trinitydesktop.org).
